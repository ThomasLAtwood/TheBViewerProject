	<H2>Selecting a Standard Image for Viewing</H2>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
<P>
You activate a <u>standard</u> image by clicking on its button on the Standard Image Selector Panel.  This causes the selected standard image to be displayed in the Standard Image Display Window.
</P>
<P>
Standard reference images can be magnified and panned, but no windowing adjustments are supported, since this would compromise  their display as a reference standard.

	<H2>Selecting a Subject Study Image for Viewing</H2>
<table>
<tr><td>
To select the study image you wish to view, you must first activate the study selection list by clicking on the "Select Subject Study" tab near the top of the control panel.  With the study selection list visible in the control panel window, left-click your mouse on the desired item of the study selection list.  When you click on an item, the associated image is displayed in the Subject Study Display Window, and BViewer automatically advances to the "Enter Interpretation" screen..  (This automatic advance feature can be disabled if needed:  Ask your NIOSH facilitator if you prefer to disable auto advance..)

	<H2>Composing A Study</H2>
<table>
<tr><td>
<P>
It may sometimes happen that you are presented with an undigitized film for interpretation or else you have a digital image that BViewer us unable to display, but which can be displayed using another program.  In these circumstances where you are viewing the image outside BViewer, you can still perform an interpretation using BViewer.
</P>
<P>
To do this, click on the "Enter Data to Compose a Study" button.  This will result in a popup window where you can enter data for the study.  When you exit this window a new study will appear as if it had been imported.  Click on the bright green "Add Newly Arrived Images" button when it appears, and the new study will be added to the study selection list.  If you click on it, you will be advanced to the interpretation screen where you can proceed with your reading as if a BViewer image were available.

	<H3>The Invert Colors Button</H3>
<P>
Clicking the mouse on the Invert Colors button causes black to become white and white to become black, etc.  This essentially creates a photographic "negative" of the image.  Clicking the button again returns the image to its original coloration.
</P>
	<H3>The Rotate Image Button</H3>
<P>
Clicking the mouse on the Rotate Image button causes the image to rotate 90 degrees counterclockwise each time the button is clicked.
</P>
	<H3>The Flip Vertically Button</H3>
<P>
Clicking the mouse on the Flip Vertically button causes the image to be vertically inverted, so that the top becomes the bottom and the bottom becomes the top.
</P>
	<H3>The Flip Horizontally Button</H3>
<P>
Clicking the mouse on the Flip Horizontally button causes the image to be horizontally inverted, so that the left edge becomes the right edge and the right edge becomes the left edge.
</P>
	<H3>The Adjust To Full Size Button</H3>
<P>
Clicking the mouse on the Adjust To Full Size button causes the image magnification to be set to match the actual size of the corresponding film image.  Clicking the button again, returns the image to the "best fit" size.
</P>
<P>
NOTE:  In order for this resizing to be accurate, the display monitor screen dimensions must be correctly entered on the <i>Set Up BViewer</i> screen.  You must  measure the width and height in millimeters of your screen display area and enter the values in the appropriate places on the <i>Set Up BViewer</i> screen.
</P>
	<H3>How to Adjust Window Center / Window Width</H3>
<P>
The apparent brightness and contrast of the subject study image can be adjusted by changing the settings of the window width and window center parameters in the conventional way.
</P>
<P>
Position the mouse pointer over the central part of the image.  Hold down the right mouse button to engage the window center/window width adjustment.  Moving the mouse upward increases the window center setting.  Moving the mouse to the right increases the window width setting.  You can drag the mouse around in a circular motion with the right mouse button depressed in order to "home in" on an optimum setting.  The window center and window width setting will be updated in the image window header above the image.
</P>
<P>
If it is more convenient than moving the mouse around with the right button depressed, you also have the option of entering the desired window width and window center values in the edit boxes.
</P>
<P>
You can also use the <i>Save Window Settings</i> button to save a particular windowing specification for later use.  Later you can click the <i>Apply Saved Window Preset</i> button to restore the specified windowing specifications.  This can be especially useful when you have  multiple studies being received from the same institution with  the same imaging characteristics.
</P>
<P>
NOTE:  If the linear measurement tool is active, then the right mouse button is used for that and is not functional for brightness and contrast changes.  You can restore the right mouse button for controlling the brightness and contrast by clicking the <i>Stop Measuring</i> button.
</P>
	<H3>How to Adjust Gamma</H3>
<P>
The gamma correction for displaying a particular image on a particular display monitor can be set by entering a gamma value in the small edit box.
</P>
<P>
For a properly calibrated image displayed on a calibrated monitor, the value of gamma should be 1.0.
</P>
<P>
For an image displayed on an uncalibrated monitor, a value of gamma in the neighborhood of 2.2 may be an appropriate adjustment for the display monitor's luminosity behavior.
</P>
<P>
(Technical note:  The gamma adjustment is a way of compensating for the nonlinear luminosity behavior of display hardware.  The gamma setting interacts closely with windowing brightness and contrast settings.  A calibrated display device  is already gamma-adjusted and does not need any gamma adjustment.
</P>
<P>
In some circumstances a gamma setting such as 2.2 (common for ordinary color display monitors) may have been applied to an image at its point of origin before it was stored and transmitted.  Gamma corrections should never be applied to a stored image, since this correction applies to the specific display device where the image is being viewed.  The intent would have been to preset the image to a typical gamma correction for uncalibrated viewing.  When viewing such an image on a calibrated monitor, you can undo this pre-stored adjustment by selecting a fractional gamma value less than 1.0.  In a well-controlled and well-calibrated image generation and viewing environment, you should never have to make gamma adjustments.  A value of 1.0 conforms to properly calibrated hardware.)
</P>
	<H3>The Hide Study Info Button</H3>
<P>
Left clicking the mouse on the <i>Hide Study  Info</i> button removes the text overlay displayed in the upper left corner of the image.  This information is extracted from the Dicom header of the image file and provides details such as the subject name, ID, date of birth, etc.  Clicking this button a second time will toggle the display of this information back on.
</P>
	<H3>The Reset Image Button</H3>
<P>
Left clicking the mouse on the Reset Image button restores all the image settings that you may have changed back to their original values.  The image is redisplayed as it was when you originally selected it.
</P>
	<H3>The Save Window Settings Button</H3>
<table>
<tr><td>
<P>
Left clicking the mouse on the <i>Save Window Settings</i> button causes your current display windowing settings for this image to be saved as a named preset.  Saved windowing presets can be reapplied to the current image or applied to any images you view in the future.  Clicking this button results in the appearance of the popup window shown below:

</td></tr>
</table>
<P>
Releasing the right mouse button at the end of the distance measurement interval concludes the measurement.  The distance in millimeters between the starting and ending points is displayed alongside the measurement.
</P>
<P>
NOTE:  If the linear measurement tool is active, then the right mouse button is used for that and is not functional for window center/window width changes.  You can restore the right mouse button for controlling the windowing by clicking the <i>Stop Measuring</i> button.
</P>
<P>
Left clicking the mouse on the <i>Erase Measurements</i> button will cause all the measurements currently displayed to be erased.
</P>
<P>
Measurement values are automatically compensated for image magnification changes.  By default the distance measurement is calibrated to the assumed film size and the size of the monitor display screen entered on the <i>Set Up BViewer</i> screen.  The measurements represent distances on the "film" and not necessarily distances on the subject of the exposure.
</P>
<table>
<tr><td >
 If you have some way of providing a better estimate of the actual distances, you can click on the <i>Calibrate Last Measurement</i> button after having specified a measurement of a known distance on the image.
