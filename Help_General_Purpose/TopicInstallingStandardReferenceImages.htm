Clicking this button results in a notice that you are may be about to encounter the I.L.O. standard image viewer that autostarts (depending
upon how your system is configured)  from the I.L.O. image media whenever you load it into your computer.
The I.L.O. viewer is not used with BViewer and is not involved in the standards installation process.  So, when it pops up, you just need to get it out of the way.
</P>
<P>
If you are running Windows 7 or a later version, you will probably be asked when you insert the medium whether you want to run this program.  You should answer "No".  Then you can proceed with the installation without being bothered.
</P>
<P>
If the I.L.O. viewer autostarts, just patiently wait for it to come up and display on the screen.  Then exit out of it and you are ready to proceed with the standards installation.

The standards installation process is controlled via the "Install the I.L.O. Reference Images" window.  The figure shows what this window looks like before the I.L.O. media insertion.
The installation process consists of the four steps that are shown in the right half of this window.  After you start the process by pressing the "Install I.L.O. Reference Standards" button, the four steps are executed in sequence automatically.

You may notice that when BViewer detects that the I.L.O. medium has been inserted into the computer, it relables the name of that drive on the left side of the display.

A lot of processing is involved in preparing the reference images for use by BViewer, so the installation typically requires a few minutes.  The status line for each step is updated as the images are processed one by one.  When each step is successfully completed, its status line turns green.  The figure shows how the installation window looks while the installation is in progress.
