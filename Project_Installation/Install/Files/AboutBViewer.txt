  NVidia Corporation was very helpful in creating an OpenGL driver for their Quadro
  FX-3700 graphics interface controller, which enabled BViewer to display 10-bit
  grayscale images on dual specialized display monitors.
  
  Lance Gubrud, Senior Test Engineer at Canvys - Visual Technology Solutions,
  A Division of Richardson Electronics, LTD, provided helpful support with the
  10-bit grayscale display monitors, and in interfacing with NVidia for the customized
  OpenGL driver.
